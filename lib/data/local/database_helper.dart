  'role':
      'Sanjaya’s role in the Mahabharata is that of a divine observer and messenger of truth. '
      'Unlike the warriors who fought on the battlefield, Sanjaya’s duty was to bear witness — to see, understand, and convey the profound realities of war and Dharma. '
      'Through his narration to King Dhritarashtra, he not only described the physical events of the battle but also revealed the spiritual essence of the Gita. '
      'He remained detached, truthful, and composed even in the face of tragedy, embodying the principles of *sattva* (clarity and truthfulness). '
      'Sanjaya’s character symbolizes the ideal of awareness — to see beyond illusion and remain steadfast in truth. '
      'In the end, after witnessing the entire destruction of the Kuru clan, Sanjaya emerged enlightened, realizing the impermanence of worldly power and the eternal nature of the soul.',
  'key_lessons':
      '- True vision is not through the eyes but through wisdom and spiritual insight.\n'
      '- Detachment allows one to witness truth without being consumed by emotion.\n'

      'Dhritarashtra, the blind king of Hastinapura, was the father of the Kauravas and a key figure whose attachment and indecision fueled the great war of Kurukshetra. '
      'Though physically blind from birth, his true blindness was of the heart and mind — his inability to see the path of righteousness beyond his love for his sons. '
      'As a ruler, he was torn between his duty as king and his affection as a father, leading him to remain silent even when he knew the Kauravas’ actions were unjust. '
      'His inner conflict symbolizes the eternal struggle between attachment and wisdom, between what is right and what is comfortable.',
  'role':
      'Dhritarashtra’s role in the Mahabharata and the Bhagavad Gita is that of a tragic monarch whose moral weakness and excessive attachment to his sons set the stage for the war. '
      'Though not a warrior on the battlefield, the entire Gita unfolds through his perspective — as Sanjaya narrates the divine conversation between Krishna and Arjuna to him. '
      'Throughout the war, Dhritarashtra is consumed by anxiety, regret, and guilt, realizing too late that his silence against adharma (unrighteousness) cost countless lives. '
      'In many ways, he represents the human tendency to turn a blind eye to truth when it threatens one’s attachments or personal interests. '
      'His sorrow after the war becomes a lesson in the dangers of misplaced affection, moral compromise, and failure to act when duty demands courage.',
  'key_lessons':
      '- Blind attachment can cloud judgment and lead even the wise toward ruin.\n'
      '- True vision comes from moral clarity and courage to stand by righteousness.\n'
      '- Leadership demands detachment — decisions must be guided by Dharma, not emotion.\n'

      'Out of curiosity, she invoked Surya, the Sun God, giving birth to Karna — a secret she carried with deep sorrow. '
      'Throughout her life, Kunti endured tremendous trials — from raising her sons in exile to witnessing the devastation of war — yet she faced every hardship with grace and faith. '

      'Despite her deep emotional turmoil — torn between her love for all her sons, including Karna — she never wavered from her sense of duty. '
      'Kunti’s wisdom often served as a moral compass for her children, especially Yudhishthira and Arjuna. '
      'Even in her suffering, she remained steadfast, understanding that life’s pain is part of one’s spiritual evolution. '
      'Her strength did not lie in power or wealth but in patience, forgiveness, and an unshakable faith in the divine plan. '
      'In her final days, Kunti chose a path of renunciation, retreating to the forest and attaining peace — a symbol of detachment and liberation.',
